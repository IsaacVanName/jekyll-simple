I'm a 35 year old programmer with over 10 years of programming experience. I spent much of that time leading software project teams and mentoring senior developers. I have specific experience using:

* JavaScript / NodeJS
* PHP (Laravel and CodeIgniter as MVC libraries)
* MySQL / PostgreSQL
* Redis, DynamoDB
* ReactJS, Angular 1 & 2, and KnockoutJS
* AWS EC2, S3, SQS, and SSM

I've also dabbled in a number of other things, which you can find on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacvanname). I'm always up for a good technical/professional chat, so feel free to message.
